//GitHub Copilot was used to help code in the sense, when I was writing my code, it woudl help finsish or complete it. A lot of the comments were initally done by Github Copilot. I went back and rewrote all comments for every single line in the program.
//ChaTtGPT was used in code error resolve, if I had any error in the coding process, I upload my code to see what was wrong and would correct it myself.
